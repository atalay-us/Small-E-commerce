# Changelog
0.1: Project initialized with backend setup, authentication routes, and control functions, tested using Postman
  - Project setup:
    - Frontend: React.js
    - Backend: Node.js
    - Database: MongoDB
    - Image sharing and storage: Cloudinary
  - Backend dependencies:
    - Express: For server communication
    - Mongoose: For database operations
    - JSONWebToken: For authentication
    - Bcrypt: For password encryption
    - Cloudinary: For image upload operations
    - Cookie-parser: For cookie management
    - Dotenv: For storing environment variables
    - CORS: For frontend-backend communication
  - Authentication routes:
    - User model created with fields: email, username, password, profileImg, role
    - Users can register at "/api/auth/register" by providing username, email, and password
      - Username and email fields are set to be unique
      - Password field requires a minimum of 6 characters
    - Users can log in at "/api/auth/login" using username and password
    - Users can log out at "/api/auth/logout" to clear existing cookies
    - A verify-token middleware function is used for the "/api/auth/check-auth" route
      - The middleware verifies and decodes the token stored in a cookie
      - The decoded userId is stored in req.userId
      - The check-auth route uses req.userId to find the user and return their information
    - Data from "/api/auth/check-auth" will be used on the frontend to restrict user actions

0.2: Login, Register, and Homepage pages with Navbar added for Frontend, Profile route added for Backend
  - Frontend dependencies:
    - react-icons: For icon components
    - @tanstack/react-query: For state management
    - axios: For HTTP requests
    - react-router-dom: For page navigation and routing
  - Homepage:
    - Users visiting "/" are greeted with a welcome message.
    - Logged-in users see "Welcome {username}", while non-logged-in users see "Welcome to the Homepage!".
  - Navbar:
    - Clicking the logo (E-COMMERCE) redirects users to the "/" (homepage).
    - A theme toggle button allows users to switch between light and dark themes.
    - Theme preference is stored in `localStorage`, preserving the last selected theme when the site is reopened.
    - Non-logged-in users see a "Login" link in the navbar, redirecting to "/login".
    - Logged-in users see a profile icon button (default: `<FaRegUserCircle />`).
      - Note: Code will be added to display the user’s uploaded profile picture instead of the icon.
    - Clicking the profile button opens a dropdown menu (`menu-dropdown`) with "Profile" and "Logout" buttons.
    - The dropdown closes when clicking outside, or on the "Profile" or "Logout" buttons.
    - Clicking the "Profile" button currently logs "Profile button clicked" to the console.
    - Clicking the "Logout" button logs the user out, clears the `token` cookie, and redirects to "/login".
  - Login/Register:
    - Users can log in at "/login" using username and password.
    - Users can register at "/register" using username, email, and password.
    - Form handling is managed with React and communicates with the backend via axios.
  - Profile Route:
    - Backend route (`/api/auth/profile`) added for updating user profile information.
    - Frontend "/profile" page is pending; users will later update profile details and upload profile pictures here.
  - CSS:
    - Styles (`navbar.css`) added for the navbar to ensure proper placement of logo, menu items, and dropdown.
    - Styles (`lr-form.css`) added for Login/Register pages to style form overlays and inputs.
    - Theme switching uses CSS variables (`index.css`) to support light/dark modes.

0.3: Profile Page, 404 Page, and Backend Route Updates
- Project Name Change:
  - Changed project name from "Small E-commerce" to "Store-Img"
  - Reason: 
      - Challenges with Cloudinary image storage led to a focus on image storage and removal functionality to improve Cloudinary expertise
      - Cloudinary supports two image storage methods:
      - Frontend uploads images to Cloudinary, and the backend stores the resulting URL
      - Frontend sends images to the backend, which handles Cloudinary uploads
      - Chose the second method (backend handling uploads) due to difficulties with the first, though this increases backend load
      - Becuse of this project scope shifted to focus solely on image storage and removal
- Backend Updates:
  - Updated /api/auth/login route to accept email instead of username for login
  - Updated verify-token middleware:
    - Previously stored only the decoded userId
    - Now checks if a user exists for the decoded userId, stores the full user object in req.user, and returns an appropriate error if the user is not found
  - Updated /api/auth/check-auth route to work with the updated verify-token middleware
  - Updated /api/profile/change-user-info/:id route to handle user information updates
  - Added /api/profile/change-profile-img/:id route for uploading profile images using Cloudinary
  - Ensured that /api/profile/change-user-info/:id and /api/profile/change-profile-img/:id routes restrict users to updating only their own information
  - Removed the role field from the user model
- Frontend Updates:
  - Added Profile page (/profile):
    - Users can update their profile information (username, password) or upload/change their profile image
  - Added 404 Not Found page:
    - Displayed when users access invalid routes
  - Updated Login page to prompt for email instead of username
  - Added CSS for Profile and 404 Not Found pages
  - Updated Navbar:
    - Profile icon now displays the user’s profile image if available, falling back to a default avatar (/avatar.png) if no profile image exists
